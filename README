# Virtual Memory Management Problem
Compare the performance of the following page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU
(Least recently used), MRU (most recently used), and optimal. You are provided with a
file containing the virtual addresses (byte-addressable) that are being referenced by
a single program (a process). Run your program with the following parameters:
Page size: 512, 1024, 2048 (bytes)
Number of frames allocated to the process: 4, 8, 12
(So you will have 9 runs, with each page size and number of frames combination. Each
run contains statistics for each of the four page replacement algorithms.
You must collect and print the following statistics
Page Size #of frames Page replacement ALG Page fault percentage

## Installation
this uses a makefile to generate the exicution code the data.txt is the file mentioned that is required for the program to properly exicute.

use ``` make ```to compile the code 

use ``` ./virtualMemmoryManagement ``` to execute the code 

use ``` make clean ``` to remove compiled files the code
